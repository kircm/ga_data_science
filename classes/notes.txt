R Commands
----------
Set Operations:

- Getting a sense of the data quality: it's good to inspect the data and perform some checks. If we find inconsistencies we should research into the source of the data.

- Merging data
merge(census1, census2, by='state')


Visualizing data
----------------
Library: ggplot  (wiki GADS4)

- ggplot works with aesthetics and geometries

- jittering, violin plots --> visualization technique to avoid overlapping  (which may happen when overplotting)

- data sources:  nytimes, guardian, nycopendata.socrata.com, 



Machine Learning
----------------
- Types: Supervised vs unsupervised     Continuous vs categorical (discrete values)

- solutions for each type of problem:  
  - regression (supervised continuous)  
  - classification (supervised categorical)
  - dimension reduction (unsupervised continuous)   
  - clustering (unsupervised categorical)

Supervised Learning
-------------------
- Steps:
  - split dataset 
  - train model
  - test model
  - make predictions on  new data (out of sample data)

- Additional steps: re-train the model with new data (being careful to get data that hasn't been "influenced" by your model)


Unsupervised Learning
---------------------
- Classification problems:
 - KNN classification
 - Euclidian distance   sqrt(Sum(x1i - x2i)^2)	



==========
2013 06 12
==========
- We split training and test sets because we want to check the accuracy on data that hasn't been used for training
- To avoid depending on the way we split the data too much, we can do cross-validation: iterate the split-train-test-generalization error several times, splitting the data differently each time. Get the average of all the generalization errors.
- What we want is to predict Out Of Sample (OOS) accuracy. Be able to tell how good will be the model when put in practice

- KNN Classification: 
  - the value for K is picked differently at different interations, testing against the test data each time. This is to pick the best K.
  - KNN it doesn't produce a function as an outcome of the learning phase. It just applies the Euclidian distances K times.

- Linear Regression
  - If we have attributes that are categories (example: male/female) we can create dummy variables to represent the attributes. Example: 
     Sex  MaleAttr      FemaleAttr
     ---  --------      ----------
     Male    1              0
     Fem     0              1

   - Because the attributes are mutually exclusive, we can use the intercept to represent one attribute (female)
        y = a + bx   (where a is 1/0 (female or not)  and b is 1/0 (male or not)

   - If we have more attributes mutually exclusive (among groups), we still use the intercept

   - In general we use n-1  dummy variables for each attribute that has n possible mutually exclusive values

   - Residuals: 
       - The response (each training Y for each sample) minus fitted values (predicted Y for each sample applying the betas)
       - The sum of all residuals is always 0 or very close to 0. 
       - When you include predictors (independent variables) in a regression, you are making a guess (or prediction) that they are associated with the DV (dependant variable); a residual is a numeric value for how much you were wrong with that prediction. The lower the residual, the more accurate the the predictions in your regression are, indicating your IVs are related to (predictive of) the DV. Keep in mind that each person in your sample will have their own residual score. This is because a regression model provided a "predicted value" for every individual, which is estimated from the values of the IVs of the regression. Each person's residual score is the difference between their predicted score (determined by the values of the IV's) and the actual observed score of your DV by that individual. That "left-over" value is a residual.

- Linear regression
  - Polynomial regression is still linear (the betas define a linear function)
  - With polynomial regression we can implement a model more complex than the plain linear (the function can produce curves, etc)
  - If the model is made too complex, we can fall into over-fitting.
  - How to check for the complexity of the model?
    - size of the coefficients (sum all the betas)
    - sum the squares of all the betas
  - Regularization:
    - L1 regularization: we want the betas to be the smaller possible while still minimizing error.  We add the term      ... + Lambda||B||    
    - L2 regularization: we modify the previous term with square, in order to penalize more the bigger betas. We add the term   ... + (Lambda||B||)^2
  - With regularization we don't just minimize the error of the predictions but also an additional term, to penalize higher betas
  - Other regularization: elasticnet (in R: glmnet) --> It applies (1-lamda)||B|| ^2    additional term
  - Cross Validation: cv.glmnet

- Probability
  - Normal distribution : The probability of each value occuring defines a normal function     X ~ N(mu, sigma)
  - Uniform distribution: The probability of each value occuring is the same for each value    P(x=i) =  1/N 

  - In R: plot(dnorm, c(-3,3))      plot(dunif, c(-3,3))

  - Probability of A OR B (where A and B may intersect) is  P(A) + P(B) - P(A intersect B)
  - Probability of A AND B occuring (where A and B may intersect) is  P(A) * P(B)   if A and B don't intersect (they are independent variables)

  - Conditional probability:  P(A|B) : probability of A given that B occurs
  - So P(A) AND P(B)  is   P(A&B) = P(A|B) * P(B)     if A and B are independent:  P(A|B) = P(A) 
  - Bayes theorem:   P(A|B) = P(A&B) / P(B)

  - In predictive analysis we can use this theorem:  P(label|data) = P(label&data) / P(data) = P(data|label) P(label) / P(data)

  - So: P(x,B|y) = P(y|x,B) P(x,B) / P(y)     where B are the betas, x is the data and y are the labels

  - likelihood: P(y|x,B) 

  - Maximizing the likelihood is mathematically equivalent to minimizing the error ==>  max(P(y|x,B))

- Regularization
  - The L2 regularization is related to the Bayes theorem above and the mathematical equivalence between min(error) to max(likelihood)
  
- Logistic regression
  - It's a generalization of the linear regression model for classification, where we have two classes (0/1, yes/no, etc).
  
  - In linear regression, the betas (estimate in model summary in R) represent what's the increase in the estimated y relative to the intercept, for each unit of increase of the corresponding x. Example: salaries  for baseball players. If x is the year the player started playing, and the intercept is 1000, and the Beta for the year is 100, then we expect that for each year played the salary of the player should increase $100 (starting with $1000)

  - In logistic regression, the betas represent an increase in *likelihood* of y (which is 1 or 0) given the fact that the corresponding variable is true, relative to the intercept.

- HW2: linear regression with cross validation - predict salaries
  - R notes
    - within the scope of R functions one can assign to global variables:   x <<- 5
    - stopifnot function can be used to perform checks within the code
    - set.seed(42) --> seed for random number generation
    - n-fold cross-validation : alternative way to split the data for n-fold cross-validation. Example: 10 folds       
        my_data_frame$fold <- sample(1:10, nrow(my_data_frame), replace=TRUE)
        train <- subset(my_data_frame, fold != 3)
        test <- subset(my_data_frame, fold == 3)
    - To get Confident interval of the model (we will se that concept later)
      confint(model)

- Probabilty
  - probability: 0.9  ==>  odds  0.9/0.1 = 9  
  - problem: the function can go to infinity if the denominator is very small and 0 if the numerator is small
  - To have more simetry solution: apply log.  log odd = log(9)
  - odds ratio: 
     - odds that a cat is cute: 0.9/0.1 = 9
     - odds that a dog is cute: 0.8/0.2 = 4
     - odds ratio: 9/4

  - logit function - transformation to the classifier
  - advantages/disadvantages with the KNN classifier
  
  - Conditional probability 
      P(beer=good | Stout=True) 
      P(beer=good | Stout=False)
         ---> the difference of them is our Beta for Stout (...verify...)

  - Bayesian Inference
    - Maximize likelihood
    - Prior: (most beers are good or bad)
    - The normalization constant is normally ignored. It's the same for all classes and it lets us find P(class C | x) probability of an element being of class C given the data
    - likelihood: P({x1,x2,...xn} | C)  --> to simplify it we assume that all the x's are independent from each other (no conditional probability).
    - This simplifies the calculation of the likelihood to -->  P(x1|C) * P(x2|C) * ... P(xn|C) 
    
    - slide 40: We want to learn the probability of each word appearing in the document given that the document is about politics
    - slide 43: Which is bigger, the probability of politics=true given the word x or the probability of politics=false given the word x
                P(POL=T|{x}) ~ P({x}|POL=T) * P(POL=T)  --> prob of "syria" given the article is politics * prob of article being politics in general. 
                P(POL=F|{x}) ~ P({x}|POL=F) * P(POL=F)
     - But remember: we assumed that all the x's are independent (not correlated) AND we dropped the term P({x}) (normalization constant). That term doesn't influence which Probability is higher :  P(POL=T|{x}) or  P(POL=F|{x})    (that's why we use ~ (approx) in the terms above)

- Questions about regression exercise (hw2)
  - glm  vs glmnet -> glm is like lm in the sense that the default behaviour is linear regression assuming gaussian distribution
  - model.matrix is a function to design matrices
  - when converting categorized attributes into TRUE/FALSE features, bear in mind that we only need n-1 columns where n is the number of possible values (categories) the attribute can have
  - functions: predict.lm
               predict.glm
               predict.glmnet

- Naive Bayes
  - performs similarly than the glm binomial classifier
  - Output:

Conditional probabilities:
       IPA
Y           FALSE      TRUE    -----> conditional probability of IPA being true vs Beer being good
  FALSE 0.7443609 0.2556391
  TRUE  0.7380952 0.2619048

       Stout
Y           FALSE      TRUE     -----> conditional probability of Stout being true vs Beer being good

- Pyton
  - Why is it good?  It's fast, memory usage and there are many libraries that get close to R functionality.

  - use ipython enhanced interactive command line

  - Create a list:   l = [1, 2, 3]    len(l)  

  - create a function:   
       def mean_absolute_error(x,y):
          return x-y / len(x)

  - import packages:  import
     - example: 
        import math
        math.fabs(-3)

  - In python loops are essential constructs to iterate logic. In R, loops are not used that much because the emphasis is on vectorized functions

  - for i in range(10)
      print i

  - def mean_absolute_error(x,y):
      for (xi, yi) in zip(x,y):
        total = 0
        for (xi, yi) in zip(x,y):
           total = total + math.fabs(xi - yi)
        return total/len(x)

  - python copies objects by reference. For example, lists are objects
     t = [1]
     u = [2]
     t = u
     t[0] = 3  ---> this changes both t and u first element 
       
  - Machine Learning in Python
    - Scikits.learn package
    - Numpy, Scipy
    - R is better for plotting functions 
    - Editors: Sublime, etc. Online: IPython Notebook
    - reference: google sklearn
    - in ipython  one can query the structure of an object:
        ?cross_val_score
    - cross_val_score returns the score for different cross validation folds  (default: 3 folds)

    - input data has to be in a specific format 
    - how to find out about the features that VW created?  
  - Python script to convert our data to the format that VW understands:  vw-ize.py 
  - VW uses linear regression (gradient descent)


- Arun's lesson 
  - Python
    - Use pandas package. It provides R-like features
  - Slides
    - Problem with classifiers: they don't give the reasoning behind the way elements are classified
    - Decision trees
  - Python example: DecisionTreeClassifier. We use CountVectorizer to split the data based on the number of occurances of each word in the document. If occ > n, left branch, otherwise right branch.

    - Reducing the number of features to make the process manageable. 
    - Example: movies.
    - Some maths:
      - Matrix multiplication
      - eigen vectors: vectors that fulfill property:   A * v = lambda * v    (where v is the vector and lambda is an scalar and A is a square matrix)
      - Covariance: similar to correlation
        - How related to variables are, having a scale.
        - Example: correlation is 0..1, it doesn't give the scale of the variables. Covariance does have a scale related to the original variable values
      - Having a matrix of examples (rows) and features (columns), we want to go to a matrix with the same number of rows but less columns.
        - for that purpose we create the covariance matrix:  cov(x1,x1) ...  cov(x1,xn)
                                                                  .             .        
                                                                  .             .        
                                                                  .             .        
                                                             cov(xn,x1) ...  cov(xn,xn)                              
        - The covariance matrix is a square matrix with dimension d, where d is the number of features
        - The matrix must have a eigen vector so that multiplying the matrix by that vector it gives us the same vector scaled by a lambda.
        - Specifically, there are N eigen vectors where N is the number of independent features. 
        - Rank(X) --> linearly independent columns 
    - PCA: Principal Components Analysis
      - Allows the automation of feature selection, picking the best features for predicting that are less correlated among each other.

- Alice class: Recommendation Systems
  - Predict a rating that a user will give to an item 
  - Types of recommendation systems
    - Content-based filtering: items are mapped into a feature space. Similar items are recommended to users that like an item. 
    - Collaborative filtering: you don't look at item features, just user-item ratins
      - Example of user-based collaborative system: you watched "30 Rock". Other users that watched "30 Rock" have watched "House Of Cards". So, "House of Cards" is recommended to you
      - Example of item-based collaborative system: you've rated an item similarly than another user who has rated another item. Your rating to this other item could be similar too.
  - Example: Pandora
    - Assign Features to some songs : style, beat, etc                         
    - Categorize songs:  [10,0,0,-10,.....]  --> ["Rock","Old",....]
    - If a user is listening to a song, find a song that's similar based on feature vector
  - Challenges of content-based filtering:
    - assign features to content can be very costly
  - Challenges of collaborative filtering:
    - "cold-start" problem
  - Jaccard: way of finding simlarities between items (google/wikipedia it)
    - Higher Jaccard rate means higher similarity
  - Example: recommendation system based on user-brands.csv pairs
    - logic
         #If a user X has selected brand B and C 
         # and a user Y has selected brand B
         # then recommend brand C to user Y
